# Industrial Equipment Fault Prediction (AWS-IoT-Project)
An IoT-driven predictive maintenance project using ESP32 and AWS services. The system streams real-time sensor data to AWS IoT Core, stores it in Timestream, detects anomalies, and triggers SNS alerts for equipment fault prevention.
Project Overview

The ESP32 continuously reads temperature and vibration values from connected sensors and publishes them to AWS IoT Core using MQTT.
Using an IoT Rule, the data is pushed into Amazon Timestream for time-series storage.
If temperature or vibration crosses a predefined threshold, SNS automatically sends an alert to the user, enabling proactive maintenance.

🛠️**Tech Stack**

**Hardware**

  - ESP32 Development Board

  - Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT22/DS18B20)

  - Vibration Sensor (e.g., SW-420 or accelerometer)

**AWS Services**

  - AWS IoT Core – Secure MQTT communication

  - IoT Rules Engine – Route data to Timestream & SNS

  - Amazon Timestream – Time-series database for sensor logs

  - Amazon SNS – SMS/Email alerts

🔧**ESP32 Setup**

 1.Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

 2.Add ESP32 board support

 3.Install required libraries:

  - WiFiClientSecure

  - PubSubClient

  - Sensor libraries (e.g., DHT, etc.)

 4.Configure:

  - WiFi credentials

  - AWS IoT Core endpoint

  - Certificate paths

 5.Flash the firmware to ESP32

☁️**AWS Setup Summary**

**1. AWS IoT Core**

  - Create IoT Thing

  - Generate & attach certificate

  - Attach IoT policy

  - Configure MQTT topics

**2. IoT Rule**

Example rule to send data to Timestream and SNS:

SELECT temperature, vibration FROM 'equipment/sensors'

**3. Timestream**

  - Create Database

  - Create Table

  - Store incoming sensor values with timestamps

**4. SNS**

  - Create SNS Topic

  - Subscribe with email or SMS

  - Trigger SNS when:

      * temperature > threshold

      * vibration > threshold

🔍 **Anomaly Detection Logic**

  Threshold-based detection:

  - Temperature > 60°C → Alert

  - Vibration above safe level (value based on sensor output) → Alert

  All alerts are routed via SNS.
